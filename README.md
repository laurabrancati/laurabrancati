**Hi, I’m @laurabrancati.**
I’m interested in data analysis for the purpose of improving efficiency, whether that be for business practices or energy consumption. 

Everything we do is data, but this data is useless unless we know how to make sense of it. I like to look at coding like a puzzle, 
every function or algorithm is a piece of the puzzle that together helps us understand a bigger problem.   

Im interested in working on more projects geared towards improving sustainability practices, so if you would like to collaborate on any project don't be afraid to reach out!

## My Repositories:
These are some of the projects I have worked on in class, personal projects, and one that I did for research during an internship. They are all jupyter notebooks and contain a folder with all the data used in each file. More information about each in their respective README files.
