Hi, I’m @laurabrancati.
I’m interested in data analysis for the purpose of improving efficiency, whether that be for business practices or energy consumption. /n
Everything we do is data, but this data is useless unless we know how to make sense of it. I like to look at coding like a puzzle, 
every function or algorithm is a piece of the puzzle that together helps us understand a bigger problem.   

Im interested in working on more projects geared towards improving sustainability practices, so if you would like to collaborate on any project don't be afraid to reach out!
